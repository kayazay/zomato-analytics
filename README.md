# ZOMATO RESTAURANT ELT PIPELINE

This is an end to end ELT data engineering project. This project uses the Zomato Restaurant dataset, an Indian multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company. Founded in 2008 by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chadda, the Zomato app is an online food ordering and delivery platform that helps you place a food order from the restaurant registered on Zomato, and get it delivered on your doorsteps.

## Problem Description
The purpose of this project is to make an end to end data pipeline which:

+ Extracts the Zomato data from a Kaggle dataset
+ Loads this data into Snowflake data warehouse
+ Transform loaded data using dbt applying Kimbal Dimensional Modeling
+ Build a Tableau report to visualize: 
        
    + `food` dashboards,

    + `cuisine` dashboards,
    
    + `orders` dashboards, and 

    + `restaurants`
     dashboards.

## Technology Stack
1. `Snowflake` for data warehouse
1. `dbt` for transformation and data modeling
1. `Tableau` for data visualization
